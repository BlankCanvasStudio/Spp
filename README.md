# Spp
Welcome to S++. This is a port of the R/numpy matrix notation (and a few datatype macros). You can index arrays much more naturally and develoopment speeds up rather
quickly. This whole system is built on points so its fairly fast. It needs some improvement (which I will get to) and the documentation will be uploaded but that's 
going to take a long time so you'll just need to read the header file until I get there.

There are a few files. I need to merge them and clear up the code base so I would use S++2.h but really I would read over them and take whichever you like best 
  There are some differences like row vs column major order matricies in each file for speed for different projects.
